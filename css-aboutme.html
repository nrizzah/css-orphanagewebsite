			<h1>Background Information of Rumah Aman</h1>

			<div class="post-blurb">
				<p>Rumah Aman Orphanage and Welfare Home which is registered body with the Welfare Department of Malaysia since March 2006. It operates the orphanage through donations, zakat, and sadaqa entrusted by public. Rumah Aman is currently have two branches in Shah Alam and the second branch is located at Saujana Utama, Sungai Buloh. The total orphans at Rumah Aman Seksyen 2 is about 20 childrens (18 girls and 2 boys) while Rumah Aman 2 Saujana Utama have 16 boys. Their average of age is around 5-17 years old. Rumah Aman's vision is to provide a peaceful home, to diligently support in children education & to nurture these young brilliant souls for the sake of Allah. We provide a peaceful home by treating the children as our own. "once the children enters Rumah Aman, they are no longer orphans," as quoted by the founder (Abdul Rehman Dakri) himself, as they have become a part of a bigger family. We ensure that the Home is fully equipped with the very best facilities and staff. We have libraries, computer labs, classrooms, a huge dining hall, pristine kitchen, a massive playground together with a futsal court, an indoor hall and a rooftop play area. We have assigned education staff and tutors to assist with the education aspect of things. From the administrative requirements to ensure that they are able to go to school (located nearby our home in Saujana Utama), to logistics, to extra-classes/tuition, and assist the children in however way they can to ensure they have the best education experience. The staff work tirelessly to ensure no children are left behind in their academics; also they play a huge role in shaping as well as nurturing the attitudes, motivation and discipline in the children. We focus highly in the Islamic character development, as we believe that with the right balance of circular academic and religious education, these children will be better prepared once they leave the nest of Rumah Aman; in search of indeper.</a></p>
